        			<h1>Daniel M. Tomlinson</h1>
        			<h3>Who</h3>
				<p>
					I am a developer. <br/>
					I am a founder. <br/>
					I am a creator. <br/>
					I am a teacher. <br/>
                                        I am a husband. <br/>
                                        I am a father.
				</p>
        			<h3>What</h3>
				<p>
					I am a technical minded creative. <br/>
					I paint, I write, and I teach. <br/>
                                        I design, I plan, and I execute. <br/>
				</p>
        			<h3>Why</h3>
				<p>
					Your legacy is not what you do, 
					but how positively that impacts 
					the world around you.
				</p>
        			<h2>Love Code</h2>
				<p>
					Since I was a young coder I found it 
					fun to teach others, especially if 
					they where passionate to learn.
				</p>
				<p>
					While at school, I was introduced 
					to coding by my young cousin that 
					sadly passed away far too early. 
					But his kind heart and patience, 
					sparked a love for coding and 
					creating, that lives on through me. 
				</p>
        			<h2>Giving Back</h2>
				<p>
					It reminds me that in the same way 
					my love for code was kindled and 
					flamed on by his enthusiasm, so I 
					can possibly help a few others 
					that are keen on learning 
					something new. I thus give back 
					freely and I am proud to say this 
					has led to many a career change and 
					has had big, and lasting positive 
					effects for quite a few people.
				</p>
        			<h2>Chasing the Craft</h2>
				<p>
					I have been a developer my whole 
					life. I am a serial entrepeneur, 
					often to my own detriment. But I 
					like to see people and projects 
					succeed. Due to this, I am a 
					veteran of many startups. 
					The biggest thrill is to know 
					something you poured all your 
					love, sweat, and tears is now in 
					the wild and used by thousands of 
					people.
