        <h1>Daniel M. Tomlinson</h1>
				<p>
					Since I was a young coder I found it 
					fun to teach others, especially if 
					they where passionate to learn.
				</p>
				<p>
					While at school, I was introduced 
					to coding by my young cousin that 
					sadly passed away far too early. 
					But his kind heart and patience, 
					sparked a love for coding and 
					creating, that lives on through me. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It reminds me that in the same way 
					my love for code was kindled and 
					flamed on by his enthusiasm, so I 
					can possibly help a few others 
					that are keen on learning 
					something new.
				</p>
				<p>
					My aim is not to teach those that 
					already know what they are doing, 
					but rather to break down the 
					simple concepts that is often 
					overlooked. To foster a love for 
					code and create a strong 
					foundation to build from.
